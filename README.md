# Spacecraft
## Team: Snowstorm Entertainment

Game Development Project made with OpenGL and C++

### Description:

A top-down isometric space shooter where a player must defend his position from a swarm of alien enemies, if these alien enemies can make it past to the bottom of the screen then GAME OVER.

### Running Environment:
CodeBlocks, OpenGL/GLUT, SOIL, irrKlang.a 

#### NOTE: common folder not provided they can be found in the discord

### How to Run it:

#### 1.) First Create a new Glut Project

#### Set the relative path for your common folder which should include dependency files such as irrKlang.a, SOIL, and GLUT

#### 2.) Create a new class naming it whatever in this instance I am creating a projectiles class which will create a .cpp and .h file in a src and include folder which we can be seen on the left where the project Manager is

#### 3.) Copy and paste projectile.cpp and projectile.h code from the master into your new Glut Project (you can find the .cpp & .h files in master's src & include)

#### 4.) Copy paste main, bin, sounds, images, and all the files in include and src besides projectile.ccp & projectile.h into your new GLUT project

#### 5.) In your codeblocks manager on the left, right click on the src folder and add all the cpp files you copy pasted over into your new GLUT project and do the same for include by adding the header files

#### 6.) Go to Project -> Properties -> linker settings-> add libSOIL.a found in common/lib and put on the top of all the other files-> next add libirrKlang.a in common/lib and leave as is.
